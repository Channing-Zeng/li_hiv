# simpler method
Instead of the complicated method we were doing before, trying to match the LTR sequences
with an adapter trimmer, tagging the reads with the sequences and then looking at their
endpoints, instead we align the reads to an augmented human genome with the HIV subtype_b
sequence. Then we search for chimeric reads, that are reads with one end on a chromosome
in the human and the other end in the subtype_b sequence, and find the end points of those
reads.

We ran this on the older files by aligning them with bwa-mem and then using the
insertion.py script to search for chimeric reads with one of the ends being in the
subtype_b sequence. This seems to have worked great for some of the samples, here
is an example from the ACH2 sample from the 10-2014 run.

![ACH2, clone 1, 10-2014 run](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2822886/Screenshots/r_z0ofp8njx9.png)

The chimeric reads map to both ends of the subtype_b sequence and the other end of the
chimeric reads are at what looks like an insertion site at chr7:33059398.

Looking at AC06-2006 from the 10-2014 run, we see a similar preference for alignment to
the ends of subtype_b:

but there are not a lot of reads supporting the insertion site.

Some of the chimeric reads in the table are likely duplicates; they have the same mapping
position on both the human chromosome and the virus, we can de-duplicate those by grouping
by mapping position and sample and choosing distinct reads. We can see that for
the patient samples there are a very small number of chimeric reads.

Here we collapse down the alignments for each sample by the start and
end site and group all of the sites where either the start or end is
the same into support for the insertion site. The majority of
insertion sites detected this way have
only a small number of reads of support. For the cell lines, there are some insertion sites
with a larger amount of unique read support. 

```{r deduped, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
deduped = t %>% group_by(chrom, pos, end, SA_chrom, SA_pos, SA_end, sample, date) %>% distinct()
sites = deduped %>% group_by(chrom, pos, end, sample, date) %>% summarise(count=n())
start_sites = sites %>% group_by(chrom, pos, sample, date) %>% summarise(total=sum(count))
end_sites = sites %>% group_by(chrom, end, sample, date) %>% summarise(total=sum(count))
colnames(end_sites) = c("chrom", "pos", "sample", "date", "total")
site_counts = rbind(start_sites, end_sites)
site_counts = subset(site_counts, chrom != "subtype_b")
site_totals = site_counts %>% group_by(chrom, pos, sample, date) %>% summarize(total=sum(total))
ggplot(site_totals, aes(total)) + geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_sqrt() + scale_y_sqrt() +
  facet_wrap(c("sample", "date")) +
  xlab("unique reads supporting the site") +
  ylab("number of sites") +
  theme_bw(base_size=8, base_family="Gill Sans") +
      theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = .5, color = "grey"),
            axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

The ACH2 samples seem to have reproducible insertion sites. We can detect in the 09-2014 and
the 10-2014 samples the chr7 33059398 site that we detected in the 06-2014 samples. We can
detect a few possible unique sites in the ACH2 clones we weren't picking up before as well. It
would be good to validate some of these:

```{r high-count-insertion-sites}
subset(site_counts, total > 10)
```

Removing the duplicates is important; some sites look like a legitimate insertion site
just considering the end point of the read but inspecting the reads mapping to the site,
it looks more like a PCR artifact. Below is an example of a site with hundreds of reads of support, but they are all identical in one of the BCL-2 samples.

![duplicate stacking, BCL2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2822886/Screenshots/ol~13j1wzcjm.png)

Unfortunately, for other samples, even cell lines like BCL2, we aren't seeing the same
outlier sites.

subset(site_counts, sample == "BCL-2-6-18" & date == "10-2014" & count > 1)

Other things we can do with this data, you can see from the reads aligning to the HIV sequences,
that we could call variants with this data in the LTR sequence:

![3' LTR of subtype_b](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2822886/Screenshots/scbm99rch-gi.png)

We can do better than we are doing, we are missing some insertion sites with this algorithm,
it looks like:

![BCL-2-insertion](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2822886/Screenshots/8ykwzisuowx~.png)

Do these not have chimeric reads in subtype_b? They do, if we look at where the mates are,
they are in subtype_b:

![BCL-2-insertion-subtype-b](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2822886/Screenshots/jh4cfbr4ry4a.png)

bcl2_sites = subset(site_counts, sample == "BCL-2-6-18" & date == "10-2014")
bcl2_bed = bcl2_sites[,c("chrom", "pos", "pos", "count")]
bcl2_bed = bcl2_bed[order(bcl2_bed$chrom, bcl2_bed$pos),]
write.table(bcl2_bed, file="BCL-2-6-18_10-2014.bed", col.names=FALSE, sep="\t",
  row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)

The ACH2 samples are the only ones that look great. The other cell lines have many reads
mapping to subtype_b but there are not a lot of non-duplicated alignments of evidence
for individual insertion sites.

Mark duplicates on these when aligning.
